            <h1>The Coyote</h1>
            
                <p>She stood on the runway watching us. Yellow iris and blue-black pupil and superior black eyelashes. Her coat the color of winter-dormant grass. She stood there watching us. Us, one thousand seven hundred pounds, our engine idled, attempting to land.</p>

              <p>There was an arroyo one mile northwest of the field where she had dug her den and given birth to six blind pups. But the season was early and the frost wasn't finished so she’d lined the den with fur from her own belly. She hunted for them, invisible in the buffalo grass and little bluestem.</p>

              <p>But here she stood on the thousand foot marker and daring us to go around.</p>

              <p>Little wolf. Spanish fox. Coyote.</p>
